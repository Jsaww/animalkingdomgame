Introduction:
<br>
Animal kingdom is a word guessing game where you're lost on a safari expedition. Your goal is to guess the name of the animal chasing you in order to escape their hungry bellies. You have a total of 8 attempts to guess correctly before they enjoy the nutrients of your bones. This game has 27 different animal names for you to guess. Hint: Not all of them are carnivores, but for some reason you look extra tasty today!
